    <h2>Creating a Repository</h2>
</div>

    <p>The ultimate first step in creating a repository is having a <span style="font-weight: bold">Github account.</span>Without
        an account there really is not much you can do.  After creating an account the next step is to go to the plus sign next to your profile name <br/>
        <a href="respo%20creation%201.png"target="_blank"><img src="respo%20creation%201.png" width ="200" height = "200"/></a>
        <br/> and <span style="font-weight: bold">click this,</span> and from the drop down click "create a new repository".<br/>
        <a href="respo%20creation%202.png"target="_blank"><img src="respo%20creation%202.png"width ="200" height = "200"/></a>
        <br/>This will take you to a new screen in the same window that will ask you to name your
        repository.  After this is complete, then you need to give a little description to communicate to others what this
        program or files do.<br/>
        <a href="respo%20creation%203.png"target="_blank"><img src="respo%20creation%203.png"width ="200" height = "200"/></a>
        <br/>Then you will click to add a read me file and click create. The repository is now created.<br/>
        <a href="respo%20creation%204.png"target="_blank"><img src="respo%20creation%204.png"width ="200" height = "200"/></a>
        <br/>This now allows you to add code and other files that will help communicate your project to others.  Also there
        is a wiki that you can establish to help you better communicate to others more details about your project. This
        will also give you the chance to give helpful hints and shortcuts within your program.

 <h3>Clone repository to a machine</h3>
</div>
<p>After creating the repository the enxt step would be to clone it to a machine.  This allows us to copy all the source
code and other documents to our local machine.  We can then do our own customizations as well as try to edit and
add content to the code.  After finishing this our next step is to sync it allow together on our local machine and then
upload it all back to the reposiotry on Github.  The final product will essentially be the same files/source code that
was on your local machine will now be apart of the repository on the the Github site.</p>
