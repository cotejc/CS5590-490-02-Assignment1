<!DOCTYPE html><!--This is labeling what this program file and type-->
<html lang="en"><!--This is to identify declare what language the webpage will be-->
<head><!--This is element is a container for metadata-->
    <title>Index</title><!--This is to title the webpage, this name will also be on the tab of the website to indicate
    this way if several webpage are open you can identify which tab belongs to this webpage-->
</head><!--This is to end or close the container for metadata-->
<body><!--This is the main body of the webpage, the main chunk of the data for the webpage exists here.-->

<div style="color:#FF0000"><!--This is a div element and a block element.  I used this to change the color of the heading-->
    <h1>Introduction to setting up and becoming familar with repositories on Github</h1><!--This is the First heading used within the body.  It is given
    a h1 indicator in order to show the level of importantce of this heading-->
</div><!--This is to close out the div element and revert back to the original style-->
<div style = "color:#129"><!--This div element is usdd to change the color of the follow text-->
    <h2>Creating a Repository</h2><!--I decided to change the color of this heading to make it stand out from heading #1
    I also decided to indicate it as h2 as it does not have the same importantance level of h1-->
</div><!--This is to close out the div element as I do not want the rest of my body to have this style-->

    <p>The ultimate first step in creating a repository is having a <span style="font-weight: bold">Github account.</span>Without<!--This is the beginning of my first paragraph
    it used the <p> to indicate it is a paragraph.  I also use span to bold certain words within the text to bring attention to them.-->
        an account there really is not much you can do.  After creating an account the next step is to go to the plus sign next to your profile name <br/><!--I used
        a line break here to ensere that the image is on the next line and does not make the paragraph confusing-->
        <a href="respo%20creation%201.png"target="_blank"><img src="respo%20creation%201.png" width ="200" height = "200"/></a><!--This is used to open the image from
        a saved location and then enable it to be clicked.  When clicked it then opens in another window, this way to view the picture better-->
        <br/> and <span style="font-weight: bold">click this,</span> and from the drop down click "create a new repository".<br/>
        <a href="respo%20creation%202.png"target="_blank"><img src="respo%20creation%202.png"width ="200" height = "200"/></a><!--This is used to open the image from
        a saved location and then enable it to be clicked.  When clicked it then opens in another window, this way to view the picture better-->
        <br/>This will take you to a new screen in the same window that will ask you to name your
        repository.  After this is complete, then you need to give a little description to communicate to others what this
        program or files do.<br/><!--This is used as a line break for formating with the paragraph-->
        <a href="respo%20creation%203.png"target="_blank"><img src="respo%20creation%203.png"width ="200" height = "20<!---->0"/></a>
        <br/><!--This is used to open the image from
        a saved location and then enable it to be clicked.  When clicked it then opens in another window, this way to view the picture better also has a line
        break for formatting of the paragraph-->
        Then you will click to add a read me file and click create. The repository is now created.<br/><!--This is a line
        break for formatting of the paragraph-->
        <a href="respo%20creation%204.png"target="_blank"><img src="respo%20creation%204.png"width ="200" height = "200"/></a><!--his is used to open the image from
        a saved location and then enable it to be clicked.  When clicked it then opens in another window, this way to view the picture better-->
        <br/><!--This is line break for formatting issues-->
        This now allows you to add code and other files that will help communicate your project to others.  Also there
        is a wiki that you can establish to help you better communicate to others more details about your project. This
        will also give you the chance to give helpful hints and shortcuts within your program.</p><!--This is used to end the paragraph element, it indicates
        that this is the end of the first paragraph within the body-->



<div style = "color:#129"><!--This is a div element again and it is used to change the color of the following heading-->
 <h3>Clone repository to a machine</h3><!--This is the heading indicated in h3 as it is not as important as the other headings.-->
</div><!--This is to end the div element as I do not want the paragraph to have the same color-->
<p>After creating the repository the next step would be to clone it to a machine.  This allows us to copy all the source<!--This is to start the paragraph and
indicate the following text will be included in the paragraph-->
code and other documents to our local machine.  We can then do our own customizations as well as try to edit and
add content to the code.  After finishing this our next step is to sync it with the repository  on our local machine and then
upload it all back to the reposiotry on Github.  The final product will essentially be the same files/source code that
was on your local machine, unless we make any last minute edits, it will now be apart of the repository on the the Github site.</p><!--This
is to indicate that the paragraph is closed and the following text is no longer apart of the paragraph -->


<ul><!--This is to indicate the following section is an unordered list-->
    <b>Quick Reference on creating a repository</b><!--This bolds the heading of the following list-->
    <li><i>Create a Git Hub account</i></li><!--The i indicates it is italized and the li indiciates it is being listed.  We have to ensure it
    has a /li to close this statement within the list-->

    <li><i>Fill in your information, as the name and description of the Repository with a read me file and click submit</i></li>
</ul><!--This is to indicate that the unorder list is done and everything after is a new section of the webpage-->

</ol><!--This ends the ordered list element, and indicates anything after this point is not longer an ordered list-->
